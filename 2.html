    <h1> Dear my brother </h1>
    I want to tell you the truth about something you can chage yourself.
    Whatever you want to do, <strong>Don't give up.</strong> <u>Just do it.</u>
    <br> Creative thinking does exist in your mind. 
    <p> First, Do your favorite. And think, think, think, and find the fastest way.
         If it doesn't exist, make it yourself. </p>
    <p> Second, Don't judge yourself and others, too. It makes you only you. </p>
    <p> Third, Negative thinking becomes a creative think. But Never dying negative thinkings couldn't make anything. </p>
    <p> Fourth, Just Do it! </p>
